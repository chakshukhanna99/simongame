Simon game made using Jquery
The game follows a simple pattern: it starts by lighting up a single button and playing its corresponding sound. The player's task is to repeat the pattern by pressing the buttons in the same order. As the game progresses, the pattern becomes longer and more complex, challenging the player's memory skills.
